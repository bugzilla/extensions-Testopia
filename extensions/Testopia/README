Welcome to Testopia!

Testopia is a test case management extension for Bugzilla. It is designed to 
be a generic tool for tracking test cases, allowing for testing 
organizations to integrate bug reporting with their test case run results. 
Though it is designed with software testing in mind, it can be used to track 
testing on virtually anything in the engineering process.

The following installation instructions assume you are installing the latest version of Testopia, currently version 2.4.

=== Requirements ===
* Bugzilla 3.6+
* Perl JSON 2.10
* GD-Graph3d 0.63

Testopia is an extension to Bugzilla. This means that if you have one of the
supported versions of Bugzilla installed, you are all set to install Testopia.
Installation instructions for Bugzilla can be found at http://bugzilla.org

'''IMPORTANT NOTES:''' 
These instructions assume you have installed Bugzilla according to the Bugzilla 
instructions (from tarball or cvs). Installations from Debian .deb or from some 
RPM packages may place Bugzilla files in separate directories in which case, 
these instructions may not work.

If you are upgrading from 2.2 and have made modifications to the Testopia code, 
please be aware that you will need to merge your changes into the new 
file locations.

Also be sure to reverse the patch on your existing installation
before unzipping the package.

Please make sure that your language of Bugzilla is the same as language of 
Testopia to  be installed on. If you are not sure, just set language of your 
Bugzilla to English. You can change it any time later.

API USERS TAKE NOTE: Positional parameters are now deprecated as of 2.4. All params should now be sent
in a hash (struct, dict, hashmap or whatever your language of choice calls key, value pairs). Though all attempts
have been made to provide continuing support for positional parameters, please be aware that 
some API calls may fail until you make this change. Also, future versions may remove this support completely.

=== Installation on Linux ===
                                   
''' From the tarball: '''
If you are installing Testopia from the release tarball, simply untar the
tarball in your bugzilla top level directory. On Linux this would look
something like this:

  $> cp testopia-<version>.tar.gz /path/to/bugzilla
  $> cd /path/to/bugzilla
  $> tar xzvf testopia-<version>.tar.gz

Next you need to patch the Bugzilla files. Find the patch file in the 
extensions/Testopia directory matching your version of Bugzilla.
For example, if you are running Bugzilla 3.6.1 you will apply the patch-3.6.1 patch file.
 
  $> patch -p0 -i extensions/Testopia/patch-3.6.1
 
Finally, you need to run checksetup.pl

  $> ./checksetup.pl

If you are missing any dependencies, checksetup.pl will inform you. 
See "Installing Dependencies".
  

''' From CVS: '''
If you want to install the latest code from CVS you will need to do the 
following:

1. Check out the CVS code in a temporary location

  $> export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:/cvsroot
  $> cvs login
  (Logging in to anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org)
  CVS password: anonymous

  $> cvs co Testopia

2. You will now make a tarball of the source. If you like to update your 
Bugzilla from CVS, be sure to delete the top level CVS directory first.

  $> cd mozilla/webtools/testopia
  $> rm -rf CVS
  $> tar cvf /tmp/testopia.tar .

Once you have your tarball, follow the tarball instructions above to untar 
it into your Bugzilla directory  The last step is to install the Ext libraries:

  $> cd path/to/bugzilla/testopia/
  $> wget http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-3.2.1.zip
  $> unzip ext-3.2.1.zip
  $> mv ext-3.2.1 extjs

Congratulations, you should be able to see the Testopia links at the bottom of
your bugzilla pages. 

=== Installation on Windows  ===

Windows installations are not officially supported. By this we mean don't ask 
the developers for help as we have never tried to install on Windows and don't 
have any desire to. However, there have been numerous users that have managed 
to do so on their own. Here are some pointers: 

*Add a .txt file extension to your corresponding patch file (\bugzilla\testopia\patch-3.0[.x]). 
*Edit the above patch file to remove *nix line feed characters, and putting in classic DOS/Windows carriage returns.<br>You can do this manually, or with WordPad (write.exe) or numerous utilities such as unix2dos or tofrodos. 
*Download GNU Patch and install it in a directory in your path.<br>It can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm 
*Change PERL "shebang" paths from native *nix, to a Windows Format. <br>If you have MySQL Server installed, the Replace utility does a great job at this:

 C:\&lt;apache path&gt;\htdocs\bugzilla&gt; for&nbsp;%i in (*.cgi) do ("&lt;MySQL path&gt;\bin\replace.exe" "#!/usr/bin/perl" "#!C:\perl\bin\perl" --&nbsp;%i)
 C:\&lt;apache path&gt;\htdocs\bugzilla&gt; for&nbsp;%i in (*.pl) do ("&lt;MySQL path&gt;\bin\replace.exe" "#!/usr/bin/perl" "#!C:\perl\bin\perl" --&nbsp;%i)
 C:\&lt;apache path&gt;\htdocs\bugzilla\Bugzilla&gt; for&nbsp;%i in (*.pm) do ("&lt;MySQL path&gt;\bin\replace.exe" "#!/usr/bin/perl" "#!C:\perl\bin\perl" --&nbsp;%i)

From here the steps should be fairly identical to those above, meaning patch the files and run checksetup.pl. 

If you have problems please post questions to the support-webtools list. Do not email the developers directly.

=== Installing Dependencies  ===

Some of the most common dependencies you'll need to install can be easily installed in both Windows and linux: 

Install JSON: 

     perl -MCPAN -e shell
 install M/MA/MAKAMAKA/JSON-2.10.tar.gz

Install GD-Graph3d: 

     perl-MCPAN -e shell
 install W/WA/WADG/GD-Graph3d-0.63.tar.gz

In Windows, missing modules are easiest installed by running checksetup.pl and paying attention to the printout: 
<pre>C:\bugzilla\&gt;checksetup.pl
* This is Bugzilla 3.2.4 on perl 5.8.9
* Running on WinXP/.Net Build 2600 (Service Pack 3)

*                                                                     *

COMMANDS:

    ppm install TimeDate
...
</pre> 
When running checksetup.pl, you will get an "Unable To Locate Component" error related to "OCI.dll" if you do not have the Oracle perl module installed. &nbsp;If you are not using Oracle you can supress this message by running the following command: 
<pre>ppm remove --area perl DBD::Oracle
</pre> 
Remember to "ppm install DBD-mysql" if you are using MySQL!<br>

=== Upgrading ===

In general, you will need to follow these steps:

# Reverse the old patch by running the patch command you used to install with -R
# Untar the new files
# Apply the new patch
# Run checksetup.pl

'''Upgrading to latest from CVS:'''

Testopia comes with a script to update to the lates checked in version (trunk or tip). 
WARNING: This should only be done against the latest released version. The tip is 
considered unstable.

    $<path to bugzilla>/testopia/contrib> bash cvs_update.sh /path/to/bugzilla

The script can be modified to checkout a tag or version if you know what you 
are doing.
